# 🛒 Vanilla JS Online Store

A fully interactive online shop built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS — no frameworks, no build tools, just clean, structured code.

This project demonstrates how to build a complete front-end application from scratch, including UI rendering, filtering, state management, and user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📦 **Dynamic Catalog Rendering**  
  Products are loaded from a structured JSON file and rendered dynamically into the UI.

- 🔍 **Live Filtering & Sorting**  
  Multi-category filtering, sorting by price and rating — all in real time, without reloading the page.

- 🛒 **Cart System with State Management**  
  Users can add and remove products from the cart. Cart state is preserved in memory and reflected in the UI.

- 📱 **Responsive Layout**  
  Fully responsive design that works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- 🎨 **Custom UI Components**  
  Dropdowns, modals, and tooltips built from scratch, without third-party libraries.
